SBTween is a functional, but not quite finished, tweening library for iOS that I've been working on.

SBTween has a pod spec, but hasn't yet been released as a CocoaPod.

For the most recent changes, use the development branch.

## Example

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

## Requirements

## Installation

SBTween is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod "SBTween"
```
